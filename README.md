This is my first self-learnt machine learning algorithm where I use the simple linear regression method to estimate the user count for bike sharing based on certain features. However, the algorithm is not perfect as the feature selected is for simple linear regression and does not produce the intended output. Nonetheless, this is my first trial in machine learning
